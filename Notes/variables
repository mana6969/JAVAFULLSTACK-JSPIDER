 Variables :-
------------
-->Variable is a container which is used to store single value.
-->Variables are temporary memory.

-->syntax :- datatype variable_name;
			 variable_name = value;
-->Variables can't be re-declared, but variables can be re-initialised.

 Types of Variables :-
--------------------
1)Local Variables :- 
-------------------
-->The variables which are created inside the method, those variables are known as local variables.
-->Local variables must be initialised before using.

2)Static Variables(Class Variables) :- 
------------------------------------
-->The variables which are created inside the class and outside the method by using static keyword.
-->For static variables object creation is not compulsory.
-->For static variables only one copy of memory will be created.
-->For static variables initialisation is not compulsory.

3)Non-static Variables(Instance Variables) :- 
-------------------------------------------
-->The variables which are created inside the class and outside the method without using static keyword.
-->For Non-static variables object creation is compulsory.
-->For Non-static variables memory will be created for each and every object creation.
-->Initialisation is not compulsory.
